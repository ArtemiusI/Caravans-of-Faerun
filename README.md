This mod adds a new way to travel across the Sword Coast in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, adding Caravan Masters who you may hire to bring you to certain places on the map at only half the game time and no danger of random encounters. However, this sort of service does not come free, as you must pay a price of 10 gold per hour of travel.

Caravan Masters are present in the towns of Beregost, Nashkel and Ulgoth's Beard, as well as the Friendly Arm Inn and the northern side of Wyrm's Crossing, the bridge to Baldur's Gate accessible in Chapter 5. Prices are reduced to 5 gold per hour from Chapter 5 onwards due to the safer roads. The Caravan Masters are dressed in bright yellow and can be found in each location as follows:

- Friendly Arm Inn: Stables inside the fortress

- Beregost: Southern side of the town near the fountain

- Nashkel: By the town inn

- Ulgoth's Beard: Stables by the pond

- Wyrm's Crossing (Chapter 5 and onward): By the entrance to Baldur's Gate, on the northern side of the bridge

The Caravan Masters may also take you to Durlag's Tower, Ulcaster Ruins, Gullykin, and High Hedge, though these are one-way trips.
